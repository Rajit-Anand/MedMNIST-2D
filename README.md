# Medical Image Classification (MedMNIST 2D Dataset)

A lightweight PyTorch-based framework for multi-task medical image classification using the MedMNIST 2D benchmark.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This repository implements state-of-the-art deep learning models (e.g., ConvNeXt, ResNet) on diverse MedMNIST 2D subsetsâ€”covering breast, chest X-ray, retina, skin, and moreâ€”with over **438,220** total training samples. It emphasizes efficient training on modest hardware through advanced scheduling, memory optimizations, and specialized loss functions.

# NOTE: The repository is yet to be cleaned, hence there is alot of useless code as well from the early stages of project.
